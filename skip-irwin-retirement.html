        <p>Hi everyone,</p>
        <p>This is Michael Irwin, Skip's oldest son. As many of you know, he is retiring at the end of this year! </p>
        <p>To celebrate him and all the lives he's touched, we're putting together a surprise video filled with memories, stories, and well-wishes from the people who know him best.</p>
        <p>We'd love for you to be part of it!</p>
        <p>And the funnier the stories, the better!</p>

        <h2>🤳 How to Record</h2>
        <p>To help us with the final video editing, please follow these simple guidelines:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Record with your phone or computer.</strong> Whatever is easiest.</li>
          <li><strong>Start by asking the question out loud</strong>, then pause for a couple of seconds, and then answer it.
            <ul>
              <li>Example: “How did I meet Skip?” pause “Well…”</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Film in a quiet, well-lit space.</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Natural light works great</li>
              <li>Listen to the video afterwards to make sure you can hear yourself clearly and there isn't too much background noise covering you up.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Record all prompts in one recording</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>If you make a mistake, don't feel like you have to start over. Simply start the prompt over again and go from there. After all, my dad likes jokes, so an outtakes blooper reel might be fun too!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Landscape orientation is preferred</strong>, but portrait is fine if that's easier.
          </li>
        </ul>
