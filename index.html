        <h2>What interests me...</h2>
        <p>I have always been interested in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). While a lot of HCI research focuses on end users, I like to focus on using new advancements to lower barriers of entry to modern practices (DevOps, cloud, containers, etc.). How can we bring these benefits to more teams?</p>
        <p>I strive to identify new abstractions, tools, and training methods to make these hard problems more approachable. In many cases, this means raising the abstraction layer and simply hiding much of the complexity.</p>
        <p>I'm most happy when I'm learning, challenging myself, and helping others be more productive and better able to focus on the things they want to do.</p>

        <h2>What I do for work...</h2>
        <p>I work on the DevRel team at Docker! We're responsible for engaging and supporting the community, helping developers learn and be successful, and advocating for them internally to help guide various roadmap decisions.</p>
        <p>I also teach at Virginia Tech as an Adjunct Faculty Instructor. I've taught CS1114 (Intro to Java) for several years, created and taught a Docker Containerization course for four semesters, and created and taught a Kubernetes course for two semesters! I love empowering students and helping them realize they can do hard things.</p>

        <h2>What I do in the community...</h2>
        <p>I've worked hard to contribute to the larger software community in the New River Valley. I started the <a href="https://events.docker.com/blacksburg/">Docker Blacksburg Meetup</a> and contribute to the larger <a href="https://nrvdev.github.io/">NRV Dev community</a>. I was recognized, by Docker, as the inaugural Community Leader of the Year in 2018 for the North American region.</p>
        <p>In March 2017, I was recognized by Docker as a <a href="https://www.docker.com/community/captains">Docker Captain</a>. This gave me opportunities to network with industry experts and share many of the things I've worked on. I've had to hang up my Captain hat now that I'm working at Docker, but still strive to network and teach others.</p>
        <p>I'm an active member of <a href="https://www.comeuntochrist.org/">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</a> (yes... I was one of those missionaries that went around knocking on doors). I spend many hours a week serving in various capacities (mostly with the youth) and much of my life direction and goals can be contributed back to my faith. If you have questions about what that means, don't hesitate to reach out! I love answering questions.</p>
